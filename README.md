## My process
- Firstly, I Read through the original README file and the style-guide
- Added my external stylesheet
- Embedded the code for the Google Font
- From my thought process the image is a body with light blue background, then a section for the  QR code, as well as a footer
- The QR code section is divided in two; the QR image itself and the content
- Everything on the page is centered vertically and horizontally
- The image and the QR section have rounded borders.

### Using Flexbox
- I used Flexbox to vertically center the section
- I also used Flexbox to center all content inside the section

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Not much honestly, but I got to practice what I know so hopefully I learned something subconsciously




### Continued development

My problems areanis :
- Manipulating width sizes without hard-coding anything, especially with sentences that take up the complete width space.
